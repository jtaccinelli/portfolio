    <p>
      I'm always open to hearing about any interesting work, but at the moment

    <ol class="flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-1">

      <li>Part of a meaningful social or community initiative.</li>
      <li>Pay me appropriately for working outside of my standard hours.</li>
    </ol>

      If you have something you think you might want to work together on, don't
      hestiate to <a href="#contact" class="underline underline-offset-2"
