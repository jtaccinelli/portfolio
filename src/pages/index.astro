    <p>
      I'm a generalist by design - I've worked on digital projects from
      conception to delivery, and have at least dabbled in every stage of the
      process. It means I'm uniquely positioned jump in wherever required to
      deliver value, or to help take your digital idea and make it a reality.

  <Content heading="All of my projects are passion projects.">
    <p>
      I love working on projects that are doing something new, something
      meaningful, or something interesting. Projects that meet those criteria
      get my cogs turning, and I do my best work when I'm engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I highly value projects that give back to the community, and projects that
      help support local business and meaningful causes. I don't take on work I
      don't feel meets those criteria.

    <p>
      I am currently on a weekly quest to dethrone our local trivia regulars.
      After searching far and wide, I can highly recommend <a
        href="https://www.isolationtrivia.com/"
        target="_blank"
        class="underline underline-offset-4">Isolation Trivia</a
      > for a good night out with questions that don't feel like they were ripped
      out of the 60's.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love a good meal - cheap or fancy, local or extravagant - so long
      as it tastes good, I'm 100% there. Fun fact; I once did the Riess
      Motivation Profile and my main motivator in life was 'Food'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unrelated, but I have been known to take food as compensation. Just so you
      know.

      I get approached every now and then (mostly then) about certain questions
      people have about my work
    </p>
    <p>
      I find a Q & A format is a more effective way to give people the
      information they're looking for.
