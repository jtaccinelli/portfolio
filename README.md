## About this project

This project is built as a micro-portfolio, mainly as a test for TinaCMS to see what it's pros and cons are. I use my portfolio as an opportunity to test new tech stacks and ideas, so this has changed frequently. This has gone from:

- Prismic & NextJS
- Remix & Sanity
- Astro & TinaCMS (Current)

### This project is built with

- `typescript` - For static type checking
- `tailwindcss` - For utility class based styling
- `tinacms` - For content management
- `astro` - For the static generator
- `yarn` - For package management and workspaces
- `netlify` - For site hosting & management
